  ## Description

  Every developer knows that creating a README.md file is key to high quality project because it helps other people to understand, try and improve the code in the repository. However, sometimes creating a README.md file could be time consuming. With this application, I solved that problem learning Node.js and inquirer to prompt user questions to fill out and complete the README.md quickly!
